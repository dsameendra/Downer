## üíΩ Installation Guide

### 1. Download and Install the App

Head over to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dsameendra/Downer/releases) page and download the latest `.dmg` file.

- Open the `.dmg` and drag `Downer.app` into your `/Applications` folder.
- Make sure `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` is installed. If not install with `brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg`. 

---

### 2. Allow the App to Run

macOS might block the app from launching, saying:

> ‚ÄúDowner.app can‚Äôt be opened.‚Äù

This happens because the app is not signed with a paid Apple Developer account. But you can manually allow it using Terminal. Follow the instructions below.

1. Sign the app locally with an ad-hoc signature
```bash
codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Downer.app
```

2. Remove the quarantine flag so macOS treats it as safe
```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Downer.app
```

## üîß Building from Source

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Xcode
- `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, and `ffprobe` installed anywhere on disk  
  - Homebrew: `brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg`  
  - Or downloadable static binaries

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dsameendra/Downer.git
   cd Downer
   ``` 
2. Open `Downer.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Set your personal signing team

	2.	Select the Downer TARGET ‚Üí Signing¬†&¬†Capabilities tab.
	3.	From the Team dropdown choose your Apple‚ÄëID team (or add one).
Automatic signing is sufficient for local builds‚ÄîXcode will generate a
debug profile and sign the bundle.
4. Install the yt-dlp and ffmpeg command‚Äëline dependencies (skip if you already have them).
5. Build and run.
7. First‚Äërun setup
	1.	Go to Settings ‚Üí Tool¬†Paths.
	2.  Verify the paths to yt-dlp, ffmpeg, and ffprobe (Homebrew defaults should be auto‚Äëdetected).
	3.  Choose a global shortcut if you like.

## üì¶ Installing Locally
If you're building the app yourself via Xcode, you can export and install it manually like this:
1. In **Xcode**, go to `Product` ‚Üí `Archive`
2. Once the archive is complete, Xcode will open the **Organizer** window
3. Click **Distribute App** ‚Üí choose **Custom** ‚Üí then **Copy App**
4. Save the exported `.app` file to your desired location on disk
5. Copy the `Downer.app` to your `/Applications` folder
